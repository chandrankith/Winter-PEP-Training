# Day 7: Django Project

we have started our journey of web development using django.

This directory contains the code for Day 7, featuring a Django project named `mysite`.

## Contents
- **mysite/**: The main Django project directory.
  - **polls/**: A polling application within the project.
- **django_uv/**: Directory for environment configuration.

We have learnt about Django and created a simple Django project with a polls app.
